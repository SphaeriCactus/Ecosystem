# Ecosystem
A simulated ecosystem using genetic algorithms and steering behaviors


This is more of an experiment to combine steering behaviours and genetic algorithms in a more "organic" way by having the selected parents actually meet. This is based on this coding challenge by Daniel Shiffman: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flxOkx0yLrY


However my project more just got inspiration from that coding challenge, and was more of a combination of these two courses (also by Daniel Shiffman):
